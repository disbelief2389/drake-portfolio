                    This project was really cool to make. It was very early on in the course, and I was just starting to get the hang of things. I was tasked with creating a tribute page to someone I admired. I chose Terence McKenna, a philosopher and ethnobotanist who was known for his work with psychedelics and his theories on human evolution.

                    If I were ever to make my own personal blog, or expand this website to become one, I would definitely include this kind of content, documenting my studies of the ideas that this man and others around him transmuted.

                    This project was a great way to get my feet wet with HTML and CSS. I learned a lot about how to structure a webpage, and how to style it to look the way I wanted. I also learned a lot about the core fundamentals of positioning elements on a page, and how to make them responsive to different screen sizes.
