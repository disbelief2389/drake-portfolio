                    This project is a cash register app that tells you how much change you need to give to a customer. It takes the bill amount and the cash given by the customer as input and then shows the output of the number of notes to return.

                    This project was interesting. I did not know that you could make such an app using web development languages. Perhaps this was solely because my previous web development experience was fairly limited to basic HTML and CSS.
                    <br><br>
                    It also taught me that math plays a massive role in JavaScript, and likely moreso the more advanced the programming language. Maybe not, we'll see.
