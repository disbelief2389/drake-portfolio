                    This project is a simple palindrome checker. It checks if the inputed string is a palindrome or not, and displays the result.

                    This one was pretty straightforward, just using regex comparing text with some clever algebra.
                    <br><br>
                    To say that I understand said algebra would be a lie, but you've got to start somewhere. Plus, what the hand does, the mind remembers, and practice makes perfect.
                    <br><br>
                    In school when I put my mind to it, I was pretty good at math. I remember acing every test once I really put all my effort chips onto the table. I remember the feeling of accomplishment, the surprise at the 'ease' of the success.
                    <br><br>
                    Trying to hone in on that special switch has been the cornerstone of my late adolescence and early adulthood. To really start from the gate with the mindset that I have come to cultivate. From the get-go, to say, "I am of worthy. I am capable. I am deserving." To condition myself to believe that I am capable of anything I put my mind to, and then to sit back and watch the magic happen.
