						So I recently saw online people recommending Harvard's
						CS50 free computer science course. I usually just don't
						bother with established institutions like Harvard, but
						I've made an exception for Harvard now as this course is
						the best computer science course I have taken to date.
						Lower level languages, they break things down into
						common English, whilst still keeping things interesting.
						To be honest I actually contribute its success largely
						not to the reputation of Harvard believe it or not, but
						more to the format in which the main lectures are
						delivered. Because they are delivered live, there is
						more pressure I feel on the professor to actually
						research and understand the material rather than virtue
						signal knowledge and replace insight with slop.
						<br /><br />
						The first 'week' is in C; I'm trying not to judge too
						soon, but I enjoy C and my initial emotion when I
						noticed that not every week would be C was sadness. I am
						grateful nonetheless. I'm particularly excited to apply
						this new knowledge to other projects that I've been
						struggling to program, particularly this hybrid timer
						for android, that basically starts off as a stopwatch
						and reminds you every 30 minutes that such time has
						passed, and then when you want to take a break, you tap
						the screen and the time counts back down from whatever
						the state of the stopwatch was when you hit 'take
						break'. This seems like a fairly simple concept but
						apparently not, as I was not able to work AI into making
						it for me due to my lack of knowledge generally when it
						comes to lower-level programming languages or anything
						beyond basic frontend like HTML and CSS. Once you start
						talking about C, C#, Java, Kotlin, even Python,
						JavaScript... that's where I have struggled the most;
						the behind the scenes programmatic logic and fundamental
						computer science.
						<br /><br />
						I also attribute a lot of this course's value in its use
						of AI. It has its own available to you at all times that
						is programmed specifically not to give you code or
						answers, though it has once given me a sample of code
						which was out of character... but this has really helped
						me to get help whilst still actually working out the
						problem on my own and not progressively delegating more
						and more of the programming to the AI, and subsequently
						understanding less and less about it.
						<br /><br />
						No, what I found was that my understanding of C
						increased alongside the development of the program, it
						was a 1:1 movement, because I was in fact writing it
						myself and not just saying, hey, let me copy and paste
						your code. Again, I would still go to it and paste my
						code for reference but its rigidity in never explicitly
						writing the program for you seems to make it somewhat
						more helpful...
						<br /><br />
						Anyway. We started off small with a simple hello world
						program as you do, this was simple enough. Learning
						about basic main functions, packages that need be
						included for otherwise pretty standard default functions
						included in other programming languages. Nonetheless it
						was cool to see.

						Next was a Mario pyramid project with the seemingly
						<span class="italic">'simple'</span> task of making
						hashes appear on the screen in a particular order. Once
						I started to get a hang of the loops and using variables
						dynamically, and began to understand their obscure
						nature and potential use-cases, I was cruising. But at
						first it was quite the headache especially pre-coffee.
						<br /><br />
						After I got it though it was cool. My first challenge
						was getting simply a left facing pyramid (one where you
						do not need to manually account for any space
						characters). Afterward though we were prompted, if we
						were comfortable, to write a program that prints a
						couple of pyramids with a dynamic height perameter
						defined by the user.
						<br /><br />
						This was substantially harder. I initially
						overcomplicated things way too much, adding far too many
						functions creating disconnection in scope and
						modularity. I was spreading the code too thin basically,
						overcomplicating things, instead of trying to figure out
						the enhanced logic, just keeping it in the existing
						functions I had already written
						<br /><br />
						I think I was intimidated and completely uncertain of
						how I would even accomplish calculating each character
						like I was able to in the end. Breaking things down into
						very literal and critical components made the task a lot
						less daunting. Working with the AI duck that they give
						you helped a lot to break that down and say, ok, how
						many spaces am I going to need, followed by what? What
						are the patterns here?
						<br /><br />
						Asking that question over and over and over and over
						again until I understood the patterns was all that was
						really required. Overall, this project would end up
						serving as a fundamental prerequisite to the coming
						project, giving me the confidence to make as many loops
						as I need to complete the task. Anyway here's the code:

						So, the next project was the most fun I've had in a
						while programming, and that's really cool to say. I've
						always wanted to enjoy it. It took a while but once I
						was in the flow I wasn't even thinking and things were
						working... things became natural, I was tired as heck as
						I think the coffee was wearing off but I was able to
						somehow just work through the problems. It was such a
						breakthrough compared to my days in Kotlin trying to no
						avail to program this hybrid timer. Here I actually felt
						like I was programming something and able to communicate
						with the computer on an effective level. So, I have hope
						for the future and will one day get that timer
						programmed, because it is a great idea and will likely
						help me a lot with weight-loss, etc.
						<br /><br />
						I really can't remember a lot of the programming from
						this one, as, like I said, I was in the flow for a lot
						of it and kind of just zoned out and it was done. I
						actually achieved and passed all the tests pretty early
						on, the pain points really came from trying to improve
						the design of the code to make it more readable,
						compact, less redundant, etc.
						<br /><br />
						There is a really cool tool they have called design50
						which is basically getting AI to give feedback on the
						programming and logic design as such. Simplifying
						functions from diverse and obscure into compact and
						succinct and easy to read and understand logic. It
						wasn't easy and it took a while but I'm really happy
						with the outcome! I was able to make a program that I
						would usually be intimidated to even read, let alone
						write... turns out, with a little time, effort, and
						patience, you too can create your own credit card
						validation tool in C!
