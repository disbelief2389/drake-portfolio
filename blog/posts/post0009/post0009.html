								I'm currently listening to “How To Win Friends
								And Influence People” by Dale Carnegie, after
								watching a podcast interview with John Paul
								DeJoria, the founder of Paul Mitchell Systems
								(hair care) and Patron (tequila), who
								recommended this book as such a good asset along
								his journey to amassing billions of dollars. It
								is quite the wake-up call to me, in
								communication, that even in my (to me) sincere
								attempts to be selfless and of pure intent, I
								realise now how little I have really been
								striking through the mask to do so, and have
								been quite consumed in the mask of my ego,
								leading the sincere side of me to believe that I
								have been acting selflessly, but in fact I
								haven’t, and there is ample room to do more.<br /><br />
								It reminds me of my previous impulses towards
								service toward the elderly, left in old dusty
								places of my mind for various reasons, perhaps
								because it was not appropriate, and that I need
								to make more money… Well, I’m not making money
								now, even after months of trying. So, perhaps
								the issue lies in the lack of service I am
								really offering people. Perhaps I need to simply
								give more and ask for less, even if I sincerely
								believe I deserve more. Perhaps, it’s up to me
								to pick up this old impulse toward service and
								to give it a second shot, outside of
								institutions, but to simply do it for the joy
								that comes from filling the needs of others.<br /><br />
								I have been contemplating and brainstorming ways
								to implement the concept of “one man’s trash is
								another man’s treasure” to my advantage, almost
								quite literally, seeking to find where the
								richer folk dispose of their literal garbage,
								and to maybe catch some crumbs of gold. But
								perhaps the “trash” is a lot closer to home.
								Perhaps that gold may be found in the “waste of
								time” experiences of giving service to others,
								when I myself am in need. Perhaps, betting on
								luck is better than betting on others’ 1 in a
								million chance of randomly giving me a job, as
								my current odds seem to be.<br /><br />
								Perhaps, if I go out and give service, and show
								the value that I know that I have, that it will
								no longer be a debate, and it will be solidified
								both to myself and others that I do in fact put
								others above myself and have that within me. And
								that what I am really passionate about is
								others, collaboration, and humanity as a whole.
								I have deleted every other post on this blog,
								for I do not wish to hold onto the past in such
								a way. All of that is merely prelude to what is
								currently important. That is to get out of my
								ego and my own problems, and to lose said ego in
								someone else’s.<br /><br />
								I’m looking to find elderly to help. We are so
								divided, so I think I will continue along this
								path in order to reach them no matter what. I am
								quite uptight in that I don’t like going through
								institutions, but I think that’s fine. I’m sure
								there are elderly out there that will appreciate
								that I do not want our interactions to simply be
								a business transaction, which it can so often
								feel (and often actually be) these days. There
								is nothing wrong with human-to-human
								interaction, which may contradict what we were
								taught during COVID. But that’s fine, because
								the truth is, there is nothing wrong with us,
								nor our interactions. And though it took a
								little while for that truth to resurface, I
								believe we are on the right track.
