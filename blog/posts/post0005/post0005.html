                Today is my brother Tanner's birthday, and I don't really give a
                shit. I'm still pissed at the dude, the only hope for
                forgiveness will be in the fact that he's an idiot and doesn't
                actually understand what the implications of his actions are.
                Nevertheless, for now, there's no saving face, it's time to lock
                in and get to fuckin' work brother. I'm not really concerned
                with playing nice in all of these fucked up higher echelon
                suburban circus acts. Nah, I'm this close from getting a license
                and being legally allowed to put the finger up to all of these
                cunts.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plan is probably to look for farms to work on, I think that
                will be the highest money source, in terms of simple, hard work,
                which will involve everything I'm after, plus I'll have my car,
                and I won't be in the suburbs, nor around my fucked up family.
                Sure, I put a lot of hate on them, but to be honest they've put
                it on themselves. What goes around comes around. Treat me like
                I'm worthless because I like having an untamed inner nature, and
                I'll treat you like the brainless cunt that you're acting like.
                I see my actions as merciful toward them, obviously they
                couldn't understand that, because I don't talk about the fact
                that what they do drives me to murderous thoughts. And they
                think they're angelic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway, I try not to think about it because I just get angrier.
                When I can afford to be angry I will think about it 24/7, I
                don't care. Mum would rather me ignore things that I would
                rather not, it's that simple. And she has been the one calling
                the shots up until now. The intensity of the techniques and
                practices I intend to put myself through are going to completely
                transform me to the point where, even if they do try to contact
                me or connect with me in any way, I will be so far ahead that I
                will literally have the nuts to tell them to their face,
                whatever I want really. Right now my lips have been tied due to
                logistical complications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like I said, Mum has been in power, and there has been a
                hierarchy in her home, in her mind... you know, I don't know of
                any instances of my parents taking psychedelics and realising
                how flawed that slave mentality actually is, and it shows. They
                take offence to it, yet they don't realise they continue to
                cause their own pain by their own fear of change. Getting
                clogged up in that has been my main issue. Getting more selfish
                has been a fun endeavour, because where I would usually feel
                guilty, now I see that everyone else is doing it. And sure, that
                doesn't make self-indulgence okay, but I'm not going to kill
                myself just because everything around me feels like shit.
              </p>
              <p>
                And if word got back to the hive that I even held that opinion,
                that I was pushed to suicide by my mother, and just all of the
                fuckery that happened during my upbringing, again, they would
                take offence, play the victim, and throw some other horse shit.
                The only difference is now is that, I don't really give a fuck
                anymore. And I'm not just saying that either. I genuinely don't
                give 2 shits. When before I thought people were great? Now?
                Here, let me take my stinky sock off and you can suck my left
                toe. That's about the level of disrespect and energy going
                around. Dogpile it all on Drake.
              </p>
              <p>
                The funny part is, I actually hope they keep it coming. Like
                David Goggins, I genuinely will probably start taking clips
                recorded from their bullshit statements, God I wish I had gotten
                a pen recorder sooner. The amount of toxic shit I have had to
                push to the back of my memory in order to survive without ending
                up in jail etc... Like I said, and there is a reason I said that
                leaving this clownshow is an act of mercy. Because, I swear to
                God, if I had my way some days, they would all be dead. They
                know it too, so they double-down on that fear and shovel it back
                to me, sometimes in jokes mentioned on multiple occasions, like
                'you look like a terrorist haha'.
              </p>
              <p>
                The worst one recently was when my mum asked me what I planned
                to do when I got the car, I said I don't know lol. She said,
                "You're not going to like, run into a crowd of people or
                anything are you?" It's just hilarious. I looked at her in
                disbelief, thinking to myself, 'you've got to be fucking kidding
                me...' And she thinks I'm insane. I didn't get the chance to say
                this to her, but I sort of felt like saying even over a week
                afterward, "No, but I better not see you walking on the road,
                that's for sure."
              </p>
              <p>
                It's just funny man. Lie to me about my biological father my
                whole life and expect me to be buddy buddy with you. Any problem
                that I have with you is a mental health problem of mine in her
                eyes. News flash buster, my anger isn't the problem, it is a
                reaction, an indicator to me of some next level fuckery that is
                BASED in FACTS. Look up the term 'based'. It means there's solid
                ground, cross reference, psycho-analysis, proof, facts. That's
                why I want to get away from her, she doesn't give a single shit
                about what I care about or what I stand for. All I have to say
                to her is, I'm done being your emotional crutch, I am the oldest
                male that has been in her life longer than anyone else,
                therefore I am the one she has impacted the most. Both of my
                previous fathers couldn't deal with it, I'm simply starting to
                see why.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this situation I have been the enabler. I am simply intending
                to make a change. And to re-invest that energy into more
                productive, worthwhile investments, like esoteric and spiritual
                creativity, linguistic and cultural evolution, so on and so
                forth. We don't have time to be playing these childish fucking
                games, and it's going to bite us in the fucking arse, and I am
                sick of playing pretend with these freaks. No more fear of
                having offended someone. Nah, if you pull that shit on me any
                longer? Fuck peace, expect violence. It's been a one way street
                for people to just slang bullshit all on us while we just cry
                and complain. It is time to enter hell, where we belong. Fuck
                this, fuck that, fuck it all, fuck you and your feelings. Some
                of these structures of ours need to fall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Radical authenticity isn't just a term, it's a concept, a plan,
                an idea, that no one gave a shit about. The only reason I'm
                writing here is because no one gives a shit anywhere else, even
                here, no one gives a shit, except those that will read it, which
                will most likely be obscure individuals here and there, my
                mother, my father, whoever. This is my one way street
                motherfucker. I'm not going to harm anybody physically, I just
                want soul peace. If you get in the way of that, I can't make any
                guarantees for your safety. Put your own self-indulgence above
                the safety of my inner sanctuary? Again, I choose violence. In
                any other case, it's peace all the way.
