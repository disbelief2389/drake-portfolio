                                I'm pretty stoked today. I finished a remix (or two) that I've been working on for a few weeks. It's turned out great. Probably one of the best tracks I've made hands down, just in terms of the mix, master and composition sounding coherent, and not overly obscure but also not overly generic. It’s just got a real nice balance. And I’m confident that it’s because I didn’t have to spend ungodly amounts of time trying to get a loud master, I just get the sound I want, add the processing that works, and then boom, move on. You would think, just as non-producers do, that things like this would be easy. But I’ve spent years trying to figure out how to really push things hard without suffering on the perceptual dynamics. But, lo and behold, combining a super transparent limiter with ungodly amounts of CPU power only temporarily needed (after getting used to frequent Ableton flattening, which serve as a good break to listen to other music too and keep the ears fresh), I’ve been able to get simultaneously dynamic and loud masters, as well as clean mixes. Feels like a breath of fresh air, and something that no wonder more people don’t figure it out, it’s not overly obvious, until it is.

                                I dunno. Compression is a hard thing to hear at minute levels, especially 0.1dB of gain reduction. That’s not the minuteness we’re up to (yet), but we’re definitely in that ball park. It makes sense though. We work on these tiny tiny tiny details, if we want them to be preserved for people to actually hear, we need to work, mix and master on those minute levels, even if it takes 50 consecutive limiters pushing the signal only 0.2dB each… it’s insane but the theory works and the results check out. I feel like I’ve cracked Skrillex’s code. Because not everyone saw his limiter preset (which is ungodly on its own), not everyone copied it, and not everyone went so far as to come up with such a bizarre way of achieving near unlimited range for perceptual dynamics while having little to no headroom and thus, maximum loudness.

                                People say ‘don’t worry about loudness’… yeah, right. Let’s all just go off and be mister quiet-mix, because that’s fun. People like loud music. People like rock, dubstep, house and other loud genres. Screw that though, I like rock, dubstep, house and other loud genres. Is that a crime? No. I like how you really have to ensure that the core relationships of each element is in tact. If it’s not, when you send the track into hyperspace (when you master it), it doesn’t matter how cool the idea is, the track won’t sound good. So, focusing on the core relationships in music in order to be able to slam the music from the speakers so loud that King Kong would cross dimensions into non-fictional reality. Fuck that distinction by the way. As Terence McKenna said, ‘science-fiction taught us that anything you can imagine is fair game’.

                                But yeah, I’ve been listening to the remix I made today on repeat, because damn dude. It wasn’t sounding great at first because I was just slamming an average mix as is, without separating the slam to appropriate sections. In the final master though, I slammed the master only on the parts where I actually want to hit -5 LUFS and above. For the breaks and vocals… pfft, they can be -8 LUFS, it’s not about loudness on those parts. That’s when having those smooth, ambient, silky dynamics no where near -0dB is not only necessary but essential. To give contrast to the slam.

                                This limiter stacking works so well on kicks too man… it’s funny because the actual limiter preset usually doesn’t sound great on kicks and low end. It will sound good on just about anything else. But, by stacking the limiters, the artefacts that come from pushing it like 3dB and above never come into the equation, instead, you just get silky fatness with ultimate transparency. Anyway, I’m tired, hope you’ve enjoyed this post, you can find the final version of the remix <a href="https://www.bandlab.com/post/706a1095-33ef-ef11-88f6-000d3aa44c65" target="_blank">here</a>, or listen below, as I just remembered I can embed the code.
