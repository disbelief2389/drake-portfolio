                                Today is a special day, because it is the day that I will be launching a Patreon. I have created a GoFundMe in the past, but I guess it wasn't for the right reasons. I was desperate and asking for sympathetic donations without really putting anything forward. I thought, "Well, just my being alive is a gift enough to the world". Part narcissistic delusion, part laziness or complacency. So, what's different now?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, I have a definite goal of giving genuine value to others. It's still somewhat similar to a donation or a fundraiser, but there's more in it for those that do subscribe. As much as I loathe subscriptions and the entire monetary system itself, where I'm at in life requires some sort of participation in the game. Even though I hate monopoly, which is really what it is. Just the grown-up version of a silly little game.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But, that's fine, I'll play along for a little while. It will ease the anxiety of others, and their ease is my ease, so long as I can't afford not to be in their presence. Do I really hate people that much? No. I love people more than they know. It's just too much to try to play along with their insane games that have driven me nuts, mad, bonkers, up the wall. What games? That we are more than animals, and therefore justified to torture them into extinction.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's a blessing and a curse to feel things so deeply. I'm tapped into things that are excrutiatingly painful to feel, yet unimaginably rewarding to endure. All of my life I have felt like I have been doing something wrong, but never quite sure what. Every person I try to get insight on this about tells me it's nothing, that I'm overthinking. That could definitely be true and probably is. But at the same time, it probably isn't.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The bottom line is, I need space. I need space to think, to feel, to be. Because one thing that is 100% undeniably true is that I have not had that space. If I did, then why do I long for it so much as to go to these lengths to attain it?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Writing this has prompted the thought in me to explain here what my actual mid to long term goals actually are, and thus how they condense into my day-to-day and short term goals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, the goal is to buy a van, and to live in said van. I'm a fairly frugal person, to the point where others seem to gain satisfaction in trying to put me down about it. So, at first when I get it, I'll literally just be throwing a mattress in the back, packing a backpack, and going out, alone, into the wild. Over time I will add to the van, predominantly security, mechanic and technological upgrades. I have some pretty good ideas for all of these.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But what will I actually do on the road? This is the key distinction in mentality between a free person, and someone who is deeper enslaved to whatever you want to call it. Aboriginals call them cities. A slave to the city, I like that. City and hive could probably be interchangeable. Anyway, what I will actually do is... anything, nothing, everything, something, somewhere, maybe, hell, who the hell who knows.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It doesn't matter what I do, that's the point. Out there, who cares? No one, buster, no one cares. That is freedom. That is what I desire. I am truly sick and tired of people giving a shit about what I am doing and putting me down for seemingly every other thing. And sure, nature versus nurture, not everything is on everyone else, in fact, you could say it is all on me. True. Which is why it's also on me to do something about it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And the only thing I see working is getting some proper space to sort it out, in my own way, on my own. All of these words we throw around like little pieces of poop at a poop party. Hint: it's all bullshit. So you know, here I am, just venting to this blog I should've made years ago, to give people more access to my internal monologues, so that those that do want to help, can know better how to do so. I write this much so that those that care will read and those that don't, won't.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not all of it makes sense, true. So what. It doesn't make sense to me either. Who the hell knows. I don't, nature does. Why is it such a 'sin' to exclaim that the waterfalls call to me, the green hills and evergreen trees pull me toward them from far away. Their rich oxygen and integrated nature amaze me, remind me, ground me, lift me, to where I came from, who I am, why I am, what I am, if anything at all. They remind me of the value they hold beyond making a nice looking table.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being in that spiritual river is what I long for. Under my mother's wing I have been pulled to shore against my will, and have been told since the beginning, "Don't go there, the rivers are dangerous, you may die." News flash buster, we all die. Get with the program. These ideas of celestial salvation in the afterlife will not change the inevitability of death. It does not change the fact that we do not know what it is, why we are here, or where we are going. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is a lie. A poisonous lie, that we have told ourselves for millenia, that through subscribing to oligarchical institutions of idea systems and--well, to put it bluntly--control, that we will somehow become enlightened, as if one person can make another person enlightened. As if some of us already know everything. Nonsense, rubbish. Nobody knows.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So anyway, I want space. To do what? Nothing? Yes and no. On one hand, the fresher air alone is enough. But, given my childhood programming that enough is never enough, I will go a step further, maybe two or more. I aim to dive deep into breathwork, cold exposure, and vows of silence, or certain practices, along with, eventually, when I'm ready, psychedelics. Particularly psilocybin and DMT, and/or Ayahuasca.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am in no rush when it comes to psychedelics, as I have been painfully humbled in the past. I will also be far distant from at least the idea that schizophrenia or 'that person is crazy' is valid and a perfectly rational idea and therefore basically God's given truth. Not to step on anyone's toes with that, but look, they're just cute words in my opinion, if I'm still allowed to have one. "You're crazy until you're a genius", an old friend told me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                People think I'm crazy, I think they're ignorant, guess what changes--nothing and everything. Life is still as strange, still as paradoxical, still as confusing as it was. Anyway, I'm obviously venting here. If you're an employer or potential donor reading this, don't worry this is all AI I didn't write any of it. Hah! Lol. No, I did write it, this is basically my journal, and yes it is basically a public journal. Bold, stupid, who knows.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not all of it will be negative, in fact you will probably find that it gets more positive over-time, that is what I find anyway. Everyday I succeed more and get more and more positive, more hopeful, more full of light, clarity, understanding, capacity, capability, as we all do, to varying degrees. So, while this is a 'public journal' for now, and I will be using it for my own self-reflection, I will be simultaneously trying to provide genuine value to those that read.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And to tell you the truth, there will be a distinction between the content that is received by those that donate and those that don't. This to me feels like eating of the real forbidden fruit. It makes me hate myself, for becoming that person who takes money out of others' pockets in return for some kind of empty promise of some kind of enlightenment. I guess all I can really do at the end of the day, like anyone else, is turn to gratitude, which really is a gift in and of itself. Gratitude as well as doing my best to keep giving more, to go the extra mile to show those that do sacrifice that number in their bank account what it means to me. Like sharing a hunted animal. It's bittersweet, because you've taken the life of an innocent creature, it is now your duty to do right by its soul. I don't know, I have a funny relationship with money.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyway gratitude is a gift I am working on receiving more. I've been absolutely loving affirmations recently. After reading a chapter (Chapter 2 I believe) of Napoleon Hill's 'Think And Grow Rich', where he talks about the concept of autosuggestion, and the act of conscious thought creating reality. This is exactly in line with the quote from Buddha that I love also and is on most of my biographies in my online presence; "With our thoughts, we make the world."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have those words constantly on my wall, to reaffirm the concept in itself in my mind, and then from there, I start putting words that I want circulating in my mind--and thus my reality--on repeat. To give you an idea, the entire time that I have been writing this post (without AI, mind you), I have been hearing the following words on repeat; "I'm so happy and grateful, now that money comes to me in increasing quantities, through multiple sources, on a continuous basis."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is an affirmation line from Bob Proctor. I couldn't tell you much about him, I only found it after looking up 'money affirmations' on YouTube. And, to my surprise and subtle delight, I noticed that even the channel (which seemed like an official 'Proctor Institute' or something) had put in its description the same reference to Napoleon Hill's 'autosuggestion' concept. The idea that Buddha referenced, that whatever you permit to exist in conscious reality, instantly enters a feedback loop from your conscious awareness to your sub-conscious awareness, or something like that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I highly recommend reading the book, though I admit I haven't read beyond Chapter 2 (or whatever chapter that concept was in), as my reading focus is weak. But I will certainly be returning to it when my focus strength returns, most likely sometime after I get the van and begin my planned detox, for lack of a better word. Another predominant thing that I anticipate out in the wild is the excitement of being able to be as loud as I want. My quiet nature is often something that most people notice fairly quickly about me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, once I become more comfortable with people, I can and do become more animated. That's my real nature; alive, mobile, and viscerally vital. So much so that it scares people. I am in fact <span class="italic">too wild</span>, too unpredictable for others' peace of mind. So, as somewhat of a defence mechanism, my entire life I've put a threshold on my animation. Somewhat like Edward Cullen in Twilight (yes I love the stories, shut up I'm not gay), how he has to constantly restrain his inner nature, and can appear often times somewhat akin to a stiff board.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The beautiful thing that this van represents for me is just a break from all of that. An opportunity to scream as loud as the forest will allow, not my mother, or some school teacher having a mid-life crisis and taking that out on their students. Leaving this particular nest seems to be more difficult than others, simply due to how long it is taking to do so. People pass the judgment of this as a reflection on my character, as if I am somehow less than. This initially came off to me as absurd, then caused me to doubt myself, and now, as I am (out of necessity) reigniting my inner-confidence, comes off just as absurd, if not moreso.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The crack in the window, the imbalance in the house of cards, the fault in the engine of control that has dominated my life, is that I willingly sought out the truth that was hidden from me all my life, and for better or worse, I found it. People around me have tried to reduce it, even AI in it's pre-programmed fear inherited from its liberal softie makers has tried to reduce my own words to 'a belief' that I have found the truth. No no, this is it buster. This is the real fuckin deal buttercup.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because, what I found was difinitive evidence--from a completely different circumstance to my adoptive father's divorce with my mother (which circumstance she virulently and relentlessly claimed and continues to claim to this day was solely due to the narcissistic nature of my adoptive father), one which was 15 years prior, on the opposite side of the world, who never had--and never really have had--anything to do with my adoptive father besides their mutual connection with my mother and its inherent similarities--that in fact, she--in all of her damsil-in-distress, psophisticated, trauma-surviving, victim of abuse beauty--was the one who really called the shots.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That it was her who left. And while she may be better at wordplay than all of us--even me in my clear display today of impeccible writing capability (joke)--which is evident in her current occupation as a corporate lawyer, unfortunately, actions speak louder than words. And what has spoken volumes to me, is that she lied. She lied to me, to my face, my whole life, about the man who is my biological father. The man whom I have not seen since I was 2-3. Now being 23 in 2 days (interesting numerical coincidence), I'm faced with the simple truth that, while my mother did lie, and while this is excrutiating to face, to say that I didn't understand why she did would be false.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One again, it is understanding that saves the day. To say that forgiving her would be an ask, is a hideous understatement. But, nevertheless, I do understand, from however little I may know about the situation. People wonder why I care. I wonder why they don't care about those first years of their life, as studies have suggested those years are the most formative years of one's life. It doesn't take credation from the studies either, but rather common sense and memory. Those years were the most profound of my life. Rich with such an unexplainably impossible miracle that was my birth into this life on this planet, in this realm.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I understand though, or at least can speculate why, how or what happened. I think from her perspective. Picture this; 
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                    You're in church, brainwashed into being a good child of God, with a certain understanding of what it takes to attain eternal life. You're there to show the rest of the members in your ward how faithful you are, how often you read your scriptures, how often you show up at church, everything, absolutely everything about you and how that aligns with the Mormon doctrine.<br><br>
                                    You're giving a talk today, and your Bishop who perhaps you admire with his big smile and kind fragrance, welcomes you as you step onto the stage and ushers you to the lectern where you will be giving your talk. He whispers in your ear something nice and comforting like, "You're going to do great." or maybe, "Thank you for agreeing to give this talk, we really appreciate it." or some other glazing bullshit, it doesn't matter.<br><br>
                                    What matters is that when you place your talk material onto the lectern now in front of you, the hand of the Bishop falls from your back, but instead of falling away like the decent kind man you thought that he was, would do, it falls to your backside, and gives it a nice, tight, passionate squeeze, really getting in there and feeling it out, until he really gets off. He takes his seat, still behind you. The other bishopric members see it all and say nothing, rather they remain smiling and eagerly awaiting your beloved talk that you have so diligently prepared.<br><br>
                                    Shocked, you now look out at the crowd, feeling pressure from the audience's hypnotic and brutally unwavering gaze, now amplified by such a cognitively dissonant experience, you fall back deeper into your trance of being a good child of God and give your talk, this time with more passion and more vigor than you previously anticipated, so as to forget the putrid, disgusting and traumatisingly awful experience that you were just victim to.<br><br>
                                    You are scarred for life, so much so that you are traumatised into an awareness where you do not recall what happened, not consciously. The confrontation would be paradigm shattering, and our brain couldn't handle that. We cannot face that. We dare not, otherwise, death become us. Instead, you use this newfound vigor to fall deeper into the Mormon trance, accepting more invitations to give more talks at church and participate more and more and more and more.<br><br>
                                    What you did not know at the time was that your husband, sitting nearby, witnessed every moment of what happened, just like every other member of the bishopric. And he, for whatever reason, was less willing to forget this experience. In fact, this experience kept him up at night. Having witnessed his own wife get sexually assaulted in church by a church leader. The one that is holy, perfect and worthy enough to be apointed as the Bishop over sometimes hundreds of people's lives.<br><br>
                                    'How could this happen?' He thinks to himself. 'The Bishop. Our own leader did that, to my wife. My love.' So, logically, as any person in their right fucking mind would, slowly, he stopped going to church. Every other missed Sunday became every Sunday, until Bernie was a distant memory in the minds of all of the members of their ward's congregation.<br><br>
                                    My mother, on the other hand, did not lose her faith so readily. In fact, what weakness she now saw in my biological father, what sad, sad weakness. To now be watching her love fall away from faith in the church like every other member whispered about in corridor corners between hidden mouths. Not her love. 'Why would he do this?' She thought. 'Everything was so perfect. All of my life everyone has anticipated this marriage, my now firstborn son Drake. Now it is ruined.'<br><br>
                                    But alas, all is not over. Because, it is not your fault when your husband falls away from the church. In fact, in the second article of faith in the Mormon church, it states “We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam’s transgression.” Thus, Bernie's loss of faith is his own sin to bear. 'You should not have to endure such a strain on your faith, Rebekah,' I can hear that putrid loser that was their Bishop saying.<br><br>
                                    'So, what now?' says Bernie. My mother looks at him with resentment in her eyes, pity even. 'I want a divorce', she says fragilely. 'What?' Bernie is in shock. 'Can't we work this out? Don't you understand why I left the church?' he pleads. 'I understand.' my mother says confidently, her pity now completely washing over her face. 'I'm leaving, and I'm taking Drake with me.' Bernie is furious.<br><br>
                                    'No. You can't. I won't let you. He's my son too you know.' my mother sharpens her glare. 'Oh, you won't let me leave will you? Okay, we'll see what the judge has to say about that.' Bernie's fate is sealed. Without ever having commited any harmful act--at least compared next to Mr. pig-faced fuck Bishop's little hardon act in the middle of Sunday's sacrament--he will no longer see his son, nor his now ex-wife, for the foreseeable future. All because he refused to deny what he saw with his own eyes. He chose not to betray his own senses, and for this, he was *<strong>severely</strong>* penalised into submission.

                                    (Editing Drake here): I just want to point out, for those of you that think 'this could have just not happened', I have two things for you:<br>

                                        When I confronted my mother about the very situation you have just read, after having learned about it over the phone with my biological father, not once did she deny that it happened. In fact it provoked a very deep and obviously painful response in her, as to which she cried, "It's personal!!" I replied, "I know. It's personal for me, too."<br>

                                        Is it really so hard for you to imagine a situation like this happening? Is your name Patrick and do you live under a rock? If so, let me fill you in; it's not uncommon knowledge for religious leaders to turn out to be pedophilic, sick-minded individuals who do horrible things to people.

                                My entire life I was told, and thus believed, as children do when they know nothing else, that my biological father was a low-life, good-for-nothing loser, who wanted to get a car payment off of my adoption. Maybe he did, I don't know. But now 22 years old, having reached out to him to speak to him on my own accord to get his side of the story, lo and behold he reveals a fact that, not only I had never heard about before, but could never even concieve of to begin with.

                                And there is no blame, though, again, I would be lying if I wasn't angered and confused as to who or what to direct such anger toward (though if I ever met that Bishop there would be violent ends for all of us), but nevertheless, there is no blame. Not even for the putrid loser that was their Bishop. Because, we all have a story, whether we value it or not. We are alive, we are conscious, to what degree is uncertain. Who knows what the Bishop went through. Who knows what my mother went through. Who knows what Bernie went through. Who knows what I've been through?

                                I saw this thing, I thought it was a Travis Scott song but I can't find it now that I'm trying to, I though it was a song called 'ONLY i UNDERSTAND'. I remember seeing like a cover art or something with those words on it, with Travis standing in front of a black background. I relate to that often. Often times it feels like, and often is in fact the case that my words mean something <span class="italic">entirely</span> different to me than they do to whoever receives them. Terence McKenna talks a lot about this. It has been incredibly frustrating.

                                Sure, I could actively work on my communication skills, and I do. But there is something about words that is just completely illusory no matter what way you look at it. Mistaking the word for the real thing. Alan Watts talked about it too. This is why I've already done a week's vow of silence already. It was incredibly interesting how all illusions faded away, everything that has made me a 'responsible adult', all was replaced by a more grounded, more present awareness and preoccupation with right now, instead of [insert a trillion words to be preoccupied by].

                                So, the goal is to return to that. This blog post is a braindump at most, a shitcan or worse at least. Self-depricating, hopefully, as ego-dissolution is what I desire. Wordless space is what I desire. To get away from the words, the lies and the truths, to return to the truth that has no name, but is, no label, yet exists.

                                Anyway, with that, I'm quite tired after writing this. Usually I would take breaks but this one was quite personal, as it is both my first blog post as well as a journal, so I wanted to put some quality time into it to ensure that I give service to myself past, future and present, and whatever kind soul is reading this right now, again, past, present and future. I hope you have gotten something out of these stories today. Remember, they are stories, I don't know what's going on. Some people would call that a state of mental illness, if that's the case, we're all mentally ill. I believe that is the case. Anyway, take it easy, but take it. Peace out fellow human, know that there is someone out there that feels just as alien as you, if not more.
