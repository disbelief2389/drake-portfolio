								Below is another conversation with AI, this time
								merely to create a TL;DR for an email I intend
								to send to Olga, someone who if you do not know
								of, you will learn about here.
							</p>
							<div class="heading-hr"></div>
							<p>
								Me: i wish to make a tl;dr for this, but first I
								require you to quiz me in order to gather
								relevant contextual background for our benefit
								towards creating this tl;dr for this email.<br /><br />
								{Hey Olga, I hope you’re well. Just wanted to
								message you re Hay Jess. I’m not sure if it is
								appropriate or not, you already know I am unsure
								of any best practices if any in this scenario,
								but nonetheless, the music
								composition/production techniques and challenges
								I have been working with have been extremely
								effective, and are somewhat inherently unique to
								the way I have produced in the past. Obviously,
								for you, the tracks we make need very little
								improvement, and I appreciate you for this
								consistent and ongoing encouragement.
								<br /><br />
								Nonetheless, being the producer and engineer
								it’s my job to look for areas for improvement
								music-wise. The techniques/challenges I’m
								referring to are specifically this:<br /><br />•
								Constraint for a minimum amount of days one
								should work on a single song (ie. minimum 7
								days; my current challenge)<br /><br />•
								Constraint for how long I must not listen to
								said song on any form of high fidelity sound
								system (car speakers, earphones, anything that
								plays higher quality sound basically). This
								particular constraint I have found extremely
								effective, but have only now applied in
								conjunction with the first constraint (ie. for
								the first 50% of time worked on a single
								project, I must only listen on laptop speakers,
								phone speakers or similar [low fidelity sound
								systems])<br /><br /><span class="indented"
									>◦ This constraint has roots that go far
									back in audio engineering history. To quote
									google, “The phrase "if it sounds good on
									NS10s, it will sound good anywhere" is a
									popular saying in audio engineering. It's
									based on the idea that the NS10s, with their
									mid-range focus, help reveal the most
									important frequencies in a mix. If a mix
									sounds good on NS10s, it's likely to
									translate well to other, less accurate or
									revealing systems.”</span
								><br /><br /><span class="indented"
									>◦ Laptop/phone speakers have similar
									mid-range focus. Applying this technique has
									opened a completely new door music-wise,
									whereby every minute detail effort that I
									put in is directed toward places in the
									music where I am most likely to create and
									reveal the best out of the music.</span
								><br /><br />
								<span class="indented"
									>◦ It is so effective, that without the
									prolonged version of the constraint (I
									consider my previous usages of the technique
									where I would simply compose on laptop
									speakers for the initial session, listening
									to it back on high fidelity immediately
									after), it can be devilishly tempting to
									listen to what has been made on high
									fidelity systems. Though, similar to Taoist
									practices regarding semen retention and
									things of the like, I am finding that the
									more that you abstain from listening on
									these high fidelity systems (over multiple
									days, months, years, etc.), the longer that
									you may reap the benefits discussed from the
									technique, and ALL of which is stored and
									locked in time in the music, to be enjoyed
									as long as that audio file can be located,
									played, etc.</span
								><br /><br />
								<span class="indented"
									>◦ The final point to note is how lavishly
									high tech studios are portrayed in media.
									This can create a void where we overlook the
									value of listening on normal, everyday
									sound-systems, and overlook the aspects of
									music that actually matter to people who do
									not operate or ever even come into contact
									with such advanced audio technology...
									Long-story short, if there were anything I
									had to say to Jess, either now or in the
									forthcoming future, it would be that there
									has never been a better time to consider
									making the music that we have always wanted.
									Perhaps the door has already closed
									entirely, and the boat has left the dock,
									the train the station.</span
								><br /><br />
								Nevertheless, if I were to not reach out nor
								communicate with either of you for the
								foreseeable future due to past interpersonal
								conflicts, the one thing I would want you to, at
								the bare minimum, understand, is that my
								somewhat alien-human hybrid brain has figured
								out a way to compose and produce on the same
								page as Jess (and more broadly, artists and
								everyday humans generally), via simple practices
								and constraint which I have described above. It
								really is up to each of you individually to see
								if you can potentially find it within yourselves
								to believe in me once more, beyond societal
								norms and expectations.<br /><br />
								It is a lot to ask, I understand, and thus there
								is no pressure, as I have stated, to make any
								particular decision. We have enough of that
								pressure already. But, all I can offer is a
								simple invitation, to consider the fact that I
								may not be crazy, or sick, or anything else, and
								that perhaps I know what I’m talking about when
								it comes to audio, frequency, vibration, etc.
								Again I cannot really anticipate if you have
								this within yourselves, as we have not been
								acquainted our entire lives as I have with
								Tanner and people of the like.<br /><br />
								Even they do not understand nor care to try to
								understand, nor do I care to try to ‘make’ them
								understand, as if I ever could. Nevertheless, I
								had a good friend tell me once, “You’re crazy
								until you’re a genius.” This saying has had me
								lean into my ‘craziness’ moreso, reaping further
								benefits music-wise. For me, music is
								everything, and it leaks into realms of
								psychology, so forth. I understand people these
								days, on the surface, do not care for such
								obscure and ‘advanced’ musical techniques, which
								is fine.<br /><br />
								The point is that with these constraints I am
								bootstrapping my own weaknesses against myself,
								effectively cancelling them out via better
								workflows and musical practice basically… and
								the music is prospering from it. Only those who
								focus on these aspects and ignore things like
								immediate metrics or expectations and
								determinations, in order to look ahead to
								futures that may be, will have any chance of
								real success in my opinion. I had a similar
								scenario with a female colleague from a recent
								job of mine as a call centre agent. Her name was
								Kara, and she was truly beautiful and someone I
								resonated with instantly without even needing to
								say a word. Nevertheless she was involved and
								indulged in thought patterns and activities
								that, from past experience I understand are
								toxic and will not be healthy in surrounding
								myself with.<br /><br />
								What I said to myself, day-in and day-out was,
								‘my boat is leaving. It has yet to leave, but it
								is preparing. You have a ticket, you may join,
								if you please, but once it has left, it has
								left. That will be the reality.’ It can be
								simple to write me off as ‘crazy’. Crazy for
								believing in myself so fervently eh? Right…
								wrong, actually. I believe in God, and I believe
								that God knows, as I do, that I am doing those a
								service by sticking around and allowing them to
								prepare alongside me should they desire, for a
								journey I anticipate. It does not all make
								sense, I cannot make it do so. Not in words
								anyway.<br /><br />
								Anyway, I left the job and I haven't spoke to
								her since. I understand that there were many
								silent wordless thoughts communicated between
								us, but she has clearly made her choice and I
								mine. Music is my communication, and the more I
								refine it, the more it propels me into domains
								of indescribable beauty. That is no sin to me. I
								merely report back to you of these things I have
								seen and experienced in private moments of
								experimentation. Anyway, that’s all basically.
								The things I have done that have hurt people in
								the past, whether seen by them or not, have had
								an intentional end, beyond what they could see
								at the time, and I admit I had to make
								sacrifices at others’ expense. To buy time to
								experiment with these musical practices when
								such time was forbidden or given to me for
								purposes of ‘more productive’ activities. I did
								not ‘live up’ to these intentions, as my own
								intentions were different.<br /><br />
								I do not intend to become a sophisticated
								lawyer, nor do I wish to become a civilised
								individual, participating in common activities
								amongst other commoners of the civilisation. No,
								call me crazy, but I intend with a deepening
								intensity and conviction, to press deeper into
								to creative realms where music and frequency has
								truer and greater influence to change the real
								world for the better. Consider the Egyptians,
								rumoured to have ‘moved rocks with frequency and
								vibration’. This is crazy talk to any
								lay-person. To me, it is entirely plausible, and
								within reach.<br /><br />
								Since I am yet to unleash these potential
								technologies, I am written off as a nut.
								Nevertheless, remember my guiding mantra,
								‘you’re crazy until you’re a genius’. All I
								require from myself is patience then, and inner
								self-confidence to push through until that
								reality that I see and imagine becomes a reality
								that you see also. Anyway, enough of this, you
								are probably tired from reading, and I writing.
								So, I intend to leave soon, I now have all of
								the pieces of the puzzle, the parts of the
								engine, ready, at my disposal, to launch myself
								forward and to be free from any constraints that
								you, my mother, Jesse, Tanner, or anyone else
								may have, to fully realise my inner creativity
								into something that is not so abstract, but
								there, here, right in front of you.<br /><br />
								If Jess should ask on a simple day, or express
								interest in, any of the musical
								production/composition activities that I have
								described, however alien they may seem at first…
								again, the ship is still docked. Preparing to
								leave, yes, yet docked, still, for the time
								being. Waiting for all pieces to be connected to
								ensure a smooth departure. Consider the ideas I
								presented to you a few conversations back, where
								I explained that making music on the move, on
								the road, would be best, as we are constantly
								moving in the physical world, helping to ground
								us in whatever extreme movement we may be having
								spiritually, mentally, creatively, so that the
								differences in movement between the two
								dimensions does not create any negative effects
								in this world.<br /><br />
								Consider a trip where me and Jess left to hit
								the road, perhaps with a particular plan, of who
								and/or where the music that we may or may not
								create on that road may come to have benefit.
								Perhaps if we took it to the door of Michael,
								who is yet to respond to my, now high quantity
								of, emails. Perhaps mushroom records. Perhaps a
								mix of both, and many or few stops in between.
								It does not matter. What matters is movement,
								catalysing of creativity beyond what is expected
								or present in the ‘music industry’. For the
								music to exist, it must have music. We are music
								creators.<br /><br />
								Thus, we precede the industry. Thus, it is our
								responsibility as creators to take that
								initiative, to catalyse the visions we have and
								see, to bring those before private gifts, so
								that they may be made public and widely
								benefited from. Beyond money. Money will come.
								The beach-houses will come. Nonetheless, first
								comes service. First comes the value we must
								bring as creators to the industry, and through
								the industry, the world. The industry is like
								the car. We are the fuel. Through us spawns the
								music that the industry is surrounded around
								distributing.<br /><br />
								Anyway, that’s all. I hope you are well. Pass my
								thoughts and regards to Jesse, and that the
								reason I talk to him through you is because, you
								are integral to this group whether he may like
								that or not. I have issues with my mother as
								well, I understand. Nevertheless, you respond,
								he does not. I see a better chance at my words
								landing through the lens and lips of the divine
								feminine, which resides in every female, perhaps
								a little more biased towards yourself in God’s
								days of creating. Nevertheless, I hope you have
								a wonderful day. Thank you for reading this, and
								I wish you all God speed and the most divine
								luck in your future endeavours. Kind regards,
								Drake}

									>Okay, so I need to create a TL;DR for this
									email that Drake sent to Olga. But first,
									the user wants me to quiz them to gather
									relevant context. Hmm, let me think about
									what information is necessary to understand
									the email's core message and the underlying
									context. First, who are the people involved?
									The email is from Drake to Olga, mentioning
									Jess, Tanner, Michael, and Drake's mother. I
									should ask about their relationships. What's
									the history between Drake and Jess? The
									email mentions past interpersonal conflicts
									and that Jess hasn't responded. So maybe
									there's some tension there. Also, Drake
									refers to Olga as part of the group, maybe a
									collaborator or mediator. Next, the main
									content of the email is about Drake's music
									production techniques. He talks about
									constraints like working on a song for at
									least 7 days and avoiding high-fidelity
									speakers initially. He relates this to audio
									engineering principles, comparing it to NS10
									monitors. The user might need to understand
									how these constraints affect his workflow
									and why he's emphasizing them. Drake also
									mentions wanting Jess and Olga to believe in
									him again, moving past societal norms.
									There's a theme of self-belief and being
									perceived as crazy versus genius. He
									references past conflicts where he hurt
									people, possibly due to prioritizing his
									music experiments over other
									responsibilities. That's important context
									for the TL;DR. He uses metaphors like ships
									leaving the dock and moving rocks with
									frequency, which tie into his creative
									vision. The user should grasp these
									metaphors to capture the urgency and his
									unconventional approach. Additionally, Drake
									proposes a road trip with Jess to create
									music, targeting industry contacts like
									Michael and Mushroom Records. The idea is to
									catalyze creativity outside traditional
									industry settings. Understanding the
									significance of this proposal is key. The
									email's tone is passionate, defensive, and
									somewhat philosophical. Drake is justifying
									his methods and seeking validation. The
									TL;DR needs to reflect his main points: the
									constraints he uses, his plea for belief,
									the creative vision, and the proposed
									collaboration. Possible quiz questions could
									ask about the relationships between the
									people, the specific techniques Drake uses,
									the reasons behind those techniques, the
									conflicts mentioned, the metaphors used, and
									the proposed plans. Each answer would help
									clarify the context needed for an accurate
									summary. I need to ensure that the quiz
									covers all these areas without being too
									leading. Open-ended questions would allow
									the user to provide detailed context. Let me
									draft some questions now.</span
								>
								<br /><br />
								Quiz Questions to Gather Context:<br /><br />
								Relationships & History: What is the nature of
								Drake’s relationship with Jess, Olga, and
								Tanner? Are they collaborators, friends, or part
								of a past project? What “past interpersonal
								conflicts” is Drake referencing that might
								explain Jess’s lack of response?<br /><br />
								Core Message: Drake emphasizes two constraints
								in his music production process. What are they,
								and why does he believe they improve his work?
								How does he connect his techniques to broader
								philosophical or historical ideas (e.g., Taoist
								practices, Egyptian myths)?<br /><br />
								Intentions & Requests: What is Drake ultimately
								asking Olga/Jess to do or consider? Is he
								seeking reconciliation, collaboration, or simply
								validation? Why does he compare his approach to
								“semen retention” or “moving rocks with
								frequency”? What tone does this set?<br /><br />
								Metaphors & References: Explain the significance
								of the “boat leaving the dock” and “crazy until
								you’re a genius” metaphors. How do they relate
								to his creative vision? What does Drake mean by
								“the divine feminine” in Olga, and why does he
								prefer communicating through her?<br /><br />
								Broader Context: Drake mentions sacrificing
								relationships to prioritize his music. What
								examples does he give, and how might this affect
								trust with Jess/Olga? What is the proposed “road
								trip” plan, and how does it tie into his vision
								for music’s role in the world?<br /><br />
								Once you answer these, I’ll craft a TL;DR that
								captures the email’s essence, tone, and key
								asks.
							</p>
							<p>
								Me: My (Drake) relationship with Jess is that we
								made music under an alias, Hay Jess, for a few
								years, a duo of the two of us, which had and I
								believe still has, incredible potential for
								success.<br /><br />
								Olga is Jesse's mother, someone who gave me
								hospitality and motherly comfort when my own
								abandoned me. Tanner is my brother closest in
								age, the only full-blood brother I have, who
								tends to side with my mother and her toxic
								nature, most likely out of fear and, dare I say,
								weakness. Nevertheless, he is my brother, and
								there is a future and time for him yet. He does
								his own music, and has often banded with Jesse
								against me. I understand why and have not made
								any attempt to interfere, rather to prepare
								myself for a longer, perhaps more fruitful,
								perhaps more painful, visceral and real journey
								of music beyond the confines of my mother's
								home, in which I have been living. Past
								conflicts between me Jesse and me were just
								outrage in myself at their indifference and lack
								of empathy toward any of these issues with my
								mother, and my own weakness was not having the
								resources to not depend on them understanding
								this complex dynamic.<br /><br />
								2. already mentioned. Read the original message.
								b. already mentioned.<br /><br />
								3. not validation, but perhaps reconciliation
								and then collaboration. On a scale of dedication
								and relentless passion, and foresight unseen to
								all of us yet. b. I don't understand the
								question, sorry. Perhaps you do not understand
								my thoughts and should revise them more
								thoroughly.<br /><br />
								4. I intend to leave, and on my journey, create
								music so magical that the norms we hold high
								pale in comparison, and thus, wither away. Call
								that crazy, I do not care. Lol. b. Olga is
								somewhat of a mediator, being his mother, and
								often driving us and pushing us to facilitate
								healthy relationships and resolve interpersonal
								conflicts. Her emotional awareness and spiritual
								maturity have proven invaluable in solving past
								conflicts and thus are integral to the core
								relationships between us.<br /><br />
								5. In the past, I have sacrificed the person
								that these people had envisioned for me, a
								deeply unhappy person, for who I want to be.
								They do not yet understand this, nor how it
								could come to be. This is simply because they do
								not understand who my mother is. I, being the
								male in the longest close physical proximity to
								my mother, thus knowing her best, one could
								argue, am afforded foresight and perception of
								issues completely oblivious to others, no less
								real, no less impactful on the potential success
								of us. My mother does not value me or my musical
								aspirations. This is old news. At least to me.
								And I am the one creating the music that has
								spawned even the possibility of success in these
								areas. Thus, I hold the keys to where the music
								boat will go, and have come to the conclusion
								that if my musical destiny is to result in a
								lack of happiness on my behalf at the expense of
								others... then I simply do not want it. Others
								like jess, olga, tanner, mother, and pretty much
								everyone (as I have noticed my mother seems to
								have a curiously strong hold over others
								mentally, though the allegation of which is seen
								as pathology, which is fine. i remain aligned
								with the facts.) see this as me somehow 'giving
								up' entirely on my own musical career, as if
								they believe that my musical career must involve
								the similar void of personal self-worth as I
								have held my entire life, up until now. Perhaps
								they thought it would be different, that I would
								somehow just 'exist' and simply continue to
								provide them with unlimited creative insight
								without any effort on their behalf... it leaves
								us in an awkward and somewhat humorous (to me)
								position, whereby I am lead to give them an
								ultimatum, where either they see me as an
								individual and thereby must contribute to the
								effort that I bring to the table, or there will
								be no partnership, nor dividends paid to them.
								This is all really... just simple boundaries
								that I am learning are healthy through inner
								reinforcement of my own self-worth. Every inch
								of progress I have made is seen as a failure to
								others. What kind of life is that for me to
								live? Around people that think like that... it
								is entirely suffocating and I will not survive
								it. I do not believe anyone can, without putting
								up some kind of boundary, saying, 'I am human,
								and my vision, my dreams, my hopes, my
								intentions, my life, matters. ' That's all. No
								more is to be said than that, really..
							</p>

								<span class="italic">
									AI: Okay, let's start by understanding the
									user's request. They want a TL;DR for an
									email from Drake to Olga. But first, they
									needed a quiz to gather context. The user
									provided answers to the quiz questions,
									which gives me the necessary background.
									First, I need to recap the key points from
									the email and the user's responses. Drake is
									part of a music duo called Hay Jess with
									Jesse. Olga is Jesse's mother, who supported
									Drake when his own mother didn't. There's
									tension with his brother Tanner, who sides
									with their mother. Drake feels misunderstood
									and unappreciated by his family and
									collaborators, leading to past conflicts. He
									uses two main constraints in his music
									production: working on a song for at least
									seven days and avoiding high-fidelity sound
									systems initially. These methods are
									inspired by audio engineering principles and
									philosophical ideas. He connects his
									techniques to Taoist practices and Egyptian
									myths about using sound to move objects,
									which adds a unique, almost spiritual angle
									to his work. Drake's main message is about
									setting boundaries and seeking
									reconciliation and collaboration. He wants
									Jess and Olga to recognize his self-worth
									and dedication. The metaphors like the boat
									leaving the dock and being "crazy until
									you're a genius" emphasize his urgency and
									belief in his vision despite others'
									skepticism. He's planning a road trip to
									catalyze creativity, away from traditional
									industry norms. The user's answers clarify
									that Drake's sacrifices involve rejecting
									others' expectations to pursue his true
									self, which others see as failure. He's
									asserting his boundaries to protect his
									creative process and mental well-being. Now,
									synthesizing this into a TL;DR, I need to
									capture the essence, tone, and key requests.
									The tone is passionate, determined, and
									slightly defiant. The key points are his
									innovative methods, desire for recognition
									and collaboration, and the ultimatum for
									others to support him or be left behind. I
									should make sure the TL;DR is concise but
									includes all critical elements: his
									production techniques, the strained
									relationships, his philosophical
									inspirations, and the proposed road trip.
									Also, highlight his stance on self-worth and
									boundaries. Avoid jargon but keep the unique
									aspects like the metaphors and references to
									Taoism and Egyptian myths. Check if the
									user's main points from the quiz answers are
									all addressed. Make sure it's clear that
									Drake is not seeking validation but genuine
									collaboration based on mutual respect.
									Mention the urgency with the boat metaphor
									and the importance of the divine feminine
									through Olga's role as a mediator. Finally,
									ensure the summary is structured logically,
									starting with his methods, moving to
									relationships, his vision, and the call to
									action. Keep it under a reasonable length,
									using bullet points or concise paragraphs
									for readability. </span
								><br /><br />
								TL;DR:<br /><br />
								Drake (the sender) outlines his innovative music
								production techniques—7-day minimum per song and
								low-fidelity-only listening for the first
								half—inspired by audio engineering principles
								and Taoist/ Egyptian philosophies. These
								constraints, he argues, unlock creativity and
								ensure "real-world" listener appeal. He seeks
								reconciliation and collaboration with Jess (his
								former music partner in the duo Hay Jess) and
								Olga (Jess’s mother, a stabilizing figure in his
								life), urging them to recognize his self-worth
								and creative vision. He frames his approach as a
								rejection of societal norms ("crazy until you’re
								a genius") and toxic family dynamics (e.g., his
								mother’s dismissal of his work, Tanner’s
								alignment with her).<br /><br />
								Key Asks/Tone:<br /><br />
								Boundaries & Respect: Demands acknowledgment of
								his autonomy and creative sacrifices (e.g.,
								abandoning others’ expectations to prioritize
								his music).<br /><br />
								Collaboration Opportunity: Proposes a "road
								trip" creative venture with Jess to break
								industry norms, emphasizing movement as a
								catalyst for art.<br /><br />
								Urgency: Uses metaphors like "the boat is
								leaving" to stress limited time for
								reconciliation.<br /><br />
								Philosophical Defense: Links his methods to
								spiritual/ historical concepts (e.g., "divine
								feminine" in Olga, Egyptian sound myths) to
								legitimize his "unconventional" choices.<br /><br />
								Subtext: A mix of defiance ("I do not care if
								you call me crazy") and vulnerability, seeking
								validation through action rather than words. He
								positions himself as a misunderstood visionary,
								ready to move forward with or without them.<br /><br />
								Refined Summary (if needed): *Drake shares
								groundbreaking music techniques (7-day song
								focus, low-fi listening) to align creativity
								with "real-world" sound systems. He urges
								Jess/Olga to reconcile, collaborate on a
								transformative road-trip project, and respect
								his boundaries amid family toxicity. Framing
								himself as a visionary ("crazy until genius"),
								he warns his "boat is leaving"—inviting them to
								join his journey or be left behind.*

								these areas of debate/discussion, etc.
